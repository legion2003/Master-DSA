## About

The sole purpose of this repository/project is to help people master algorithms which increases your optimization and time reduction skills which helps everywhere.
The repository also contains some of the competitive program solutions particularly Codeforces contest solutions. As a part of Hacktoberfest Code of Conduct no spamming or irrelevant PRs will be accepted.

## How this benefits everyone✨

For Contributors - You contibute code for the algorithm/topic asked in the issue with proper comments wherever required. Your code will reviewed by me and merged only if it is the best in terms of Time and Space complexity else you will recieve an improvement feedback from me which will help you improve.

For Viewers - You get to see a curated best code for the algorithems and learn from it,  which is the fastest way to learn and helps you retain it.

## How to Contribute

-   Read the [Contributing Guidelines](Contributing.md) before making a PR.
-   Check for existing issues or create your own issues and wait for it to be assigned to you.
-   Fork the repository
-   Clone the forked repository to your local machine
-   Create a folder with the name of the data structure or algorithm or solution to a question you want to add if it is not present.
-   Add the code to that folder
-   Add a README.md file to the folder explaining the code
-   Open the command prompt and cd into the repository folder
-   Run the following Commands

```
git add .
